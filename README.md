# 🧠 AI-Powered Dodge the Falling Blocks

Welcome to **Dodge the Falling Blocks** — an evolving game entirely powered by AI.

This project is more than just a simple arcade dodger — **every core aspect is designed, played, and continuously improved by AI.** From gameplay mechanics and visuals to AI-controlled players and decision systems, this is a showcase of how far artificial intelligence can go in autonomous game development.

## 🎮 About the Game

- **Objective:** Dodge the falling blocks for as long as possible.
- **Controls:**
  - Manual mode: Use ← and → keys to move, ESC to quit.
  - AI mode: Let the AI take over and watch it dominate the game with precision.
- **Score System:** 1 point per frame survived.
- **Leaderboard:** Enter your 4-character name after death to save your score. Top 10 scores are displayed.

## 🤖 AI Integration

Every aspect of this game is infused with AI:

- **Game designed by AI:** All mechanics, code, and logic originated from an AI model.
- **AI-powered player:** The game features a built-in reflex agent that avoids falling blocks by scanning threats and moving optimally.
- **AI-managed design philosophy:** This project will continue to evolve with AI-led improvements in complexity, strategy, design, and even aesthetic.
